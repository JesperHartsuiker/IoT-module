### Introduction

Gary is an industrial designer struggling with navigating his ADHD at work. He struggles with concentration, time management, and external distractions. Despite his best efforts, he often finds himself overwhelmed by a never-ending To-do list. His colleagues Team Rocket decided to help him by developing IoT devices that he can use in the office to stay focused and complete his tasks.

## The Plot

Gary is in the office and checks his to-do list for the day. The list is overwhelmingly long, and he has a meeting to attend in between his personal tasks. He needs to finish the To-do list despite the challenges as he is going on holiday with his wife and two children the next day.

He opens the desktop app â€“ Leveling that has face tracking software installed. The app is connected to IoT device that is a blinker set next to his laptop. The team calls the device Focus Assist Blinker. The tracker of the app follows Gary's eye movements, and when he is not paying attention to the screen, the blinker is activated, and Gary's attention goes back to the screen. Despite the promising results in the office, Gary finds himself challenged when navigating external meetings without the desktop setup.

The team gathers and brainstorms on implementing a solution in the form of a small portable smart band that Gary can wear when he travels to another meeting. Gary is testing the band in his first meeting, and when he is not paying attention to his work, his wrist device starts vibrating and blinking, so he is reminded to refocus.

## Conclusion

The device is a huge success with Gary's productivity levels. The team is inspired to raise awareness for people with ADHD in workplaces and implement the devices with other individuals with similar concentration problems at work.

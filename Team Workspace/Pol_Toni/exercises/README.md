# Activities Folder Structure

Welcome to the IoT module activities repository! Here, you'll find a collection of activities that have been carefully organized to facilitate your learning experience. This introduction provides an overview of how the activities are structured and accessible:

## Root Folder: [IoT-module](https://github.com/JesperHartsuiker/IoT-module/tree/main/#iot-module-project-progress-portfolio)

  * Activity Overview:
    * The activities in this repository are numbered from 01 to 06, each represented as a separate folder named "ActivityXX", corresponding to its activity number (e.g., "Activity01" for the first activity).

  * Detailed Instructions:
    * Inside each "ActivityXX" folder, you'll find a comprehensive `README.md` file. This document serves as your guide, offering a clear understanding of the activity's objectives, requirements, and step-by-step instructions.

  * Section-Specific Code:
    * For some activities, sections or parts are organized to enhance your learning experience. These are denoted by descriptive folder names (e.g., _"example_blink"_), where _blink_ corresponds to the specific sections or parts of the activity. These subfolders contain the code related to that section.
    * Code Files: Within these section-specific folders, you'll discover code files with a `.ino` extension. These files contain code tailored to the specific section of the activity, aiding your progress.

By utilizing this structured approach, you can easily locate and access the activities, gain insights from the README instructions, and utilize the code files as needed. If you have questions or encounter challenges during your IoT module journey, don't hesitate to reach out for assistance. We've designed this structure to optimize your learning process. Happy coding!

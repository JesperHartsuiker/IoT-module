# Pictures Structure in the IoT Module Repository

This GitHub repository houses an assortment of pictures, all meticulously organized for easy access and reference. Here's an overview of how the pictures are structured:

## Root Folder: [IoT-module](https://github.com/JesperHartsuiker/IoT-module/tree/main/#iot-module-project-progress-portfolio)

  * Activity Overview:
    * The activities in this repository are numbered from 01 to 06, each represented as a separate folder named "activityXX", corresponding to its activity number (e.g., "activity01" for the first activity).

  * Code Screenshots:
    * Inside every "ActivityXX" folder, you will consistently find a folder labeled "code." Within this "code" folder, essential code screenshots related to the activity are stored. These images serve as visual aids to accompany the coding aspects of the activity.

  * Node-RED Flows:
    * Additionally, a folder named "node-red flows" can be found within each "activityXX" folder. This folder contains Node-RED flows specific to the activity. These visual representations assist in understanding and implementing the Node-RED components.

  * Evidences:
    * The "evidences" folder within "activityXX" folders contains video files as evidence of activity completion. These videos offer validation of the successful execution of the activity.

While there may be some standalone pictures or other folders present in various directories, these primary elements (code screenshots, Node-RED flows, and evidences) are consistently organized within each "activityXX" folder, ensuring easy access to the most critical materials for each activity.

This structured approach enables you to effortlessly locate and utilize the pictures associated with a specific activity. Whether you need code references, Node-RED visuals, or proof of completion, this repository's organization is designed to enhance your learning experience.

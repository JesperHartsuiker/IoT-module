# Story

Create one scenario per "pair" around your potential project in the “sustainable living” challenge domain with your parter(s) (seek for feedback of idea)
- If you don’t have your own idea,  ask chatgpt (I asked for “I need several ideas for project topics for my ‘sustainable living’ challenge in my IoT class in Estonia. - These topic ideas should be possible to be extended by the students into pitchable user stories.”)

**Remember:**
- It needs to be playable and pitchable (like example in lecture) 
- chat gpt can be incredibly helpful in this task btw, though will most likely have to be refined and adjusted by you (make sure you list your questions and a selection of answers like I did above - if you use it)

After about 30min:
- Present story/scenario inside team (2x 5 minutes)
- Discuss potential problems/challenges (5min)
- Discuss implementation possibilities (5min)
- Discuss implementation possibilities (10min) - how likely can you build something of this with the kit and what would you need to mock up, what type of integration would you need - take notes here too as pair

Seek feedback as team from instructor

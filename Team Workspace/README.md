# IoT Team Rocket Workspace

In this section, we keep a comprehensive collection of all the practical activities, visual resources, and innovative undertakings we've embarked on during our IoT module exercise sessions.

## Smaller Groups

At the guidance of our instructors, we divided the Team Rocket group into two smaller groups to enhance our learning experience. The groups are as follows:

* Group Toni and Pol:
  * [Activities and Progress](/Team%20Workspace/Pol_Toni)
  
* Group Jan, Jesper, and Roan:
  * [Activities and Progress](/Team%20Workspace/Jan_Jesper_Roan)

Feel free to explore and access these resources as they will be valuable in your IoT learning journey.

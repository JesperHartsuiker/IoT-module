thinking about what was done. 
We got an introduction about the module content, planning and grading. 
I like structured and matereial about the class so I know what is expected from me to deliver as work and how I will be graded. 
What was challenging was the group assignments as I dont have much experience with hardware and setting up the breadboard. 
Still the tasks were understandable and interesting to execute and we completed them all wiht my team member.

## Who are U?

Answer the following questions:


### What type of programming experience do you have?

I have in programming languages including Python, SQL, C#. My programming capabilities focus on the field of study I do in university which focuses on data processing, analytics and visualisation. 

### What have you done with micro controllers? Which ones have you used?

I have worked with  Arduino for couple weeks in my fist semester in university. 

### Which single board computers do you know/have you used?

I'm familiar with Arduino Uno but only a bit as I did a very short introductory course couple years ago. 

### Who is a maker or part of the maker community? What do you like/would you like about it?

The maker community consists of individuals who enjoy hands-on creation and DIY projects, using various tools and technologies to bring their ideas to life. They emphasize creativity, collaboration, and open-source sharing, fostering a culture of innovation and problem-solving. Makers benefit from the community's focus on continuous learning and practical application, developing valuable skills and a deeper understanding of technology and engineering principles.

### What do you already know about IoT?

I know that IoT involves connecting everyday objects to the internet to enable data collection, monitoring, and control, offering immense potential for efficiency, convenience, and automation.

### What are your expectations from this class?

In this class, I am looking forward to getting insights into IoT, enhancing my knowledge of of the tools and gaining understanding of the practical applications and challenges of IoT. I also look forward to cooperate with fellow students and contribute to the group project we have started in South Africa. 


## Internet of Things (IoT)

### What does Internet of Things entail?

The Internet of Things, known as IoT, is an innovative concept revolutionizing global interactions. It involves an intricate network that seamlessly connects various physical objects, devices, and systems via the internet. Equipped with sensors, software, and communication capabilities, these "smart" objects autonomously collect and share data, ranging from environmental factors to complex user behavior insights.

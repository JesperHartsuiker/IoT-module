1 Who has a lot of programming experience?
Languages used: SQL , R programming, DAX and Python 
2. Who knows macro controllers?
What have you used: I havent worked with them 
3. Who has worked with single board computers?
Which single board computers: Did a bit of work on Arduino 
4. Who is a maker or part of a maker community, knows i.e 3d printing?
What do you like? How you relate to this class? - I did 3D printing in my univeristy 
5. Who already thinks to have an idea bout IoT?
What you know about IoT? I know that is about A network of interconnected devices and the technology that enables communication among these devices and the cloud, as well as between the devices directly.A network of interconnected devices and the technology that enables communication among these devices and the cloud, as well as between the devices directly.
6. What role do lecturers play for you in university?
Fontys is university of applied sciences so its a mix between practical use and learning and lectures. I like lectures before the practical work so you can study the content and then apply it in practise
7. What are your expectations from this class?
I want to learn basics at least of IoT as I never did it before and I want to see how  we can use it for our project.

IoT task in class
1.	3 domains: 
1.1	Consumer IoT 

•	Smart Home – interconnect devices and systems within the household like thermostat, security cameras, home appliances that enhance comfort, convenience, and security
•	Wearable Devices – Devices that can be worn or implanted such as smartwatches, fitness trackers, medical monitors that track and transmit health related data 
•	Connected Vehicles – focus is on integration in automobiles such as GPS navigation, vehicle diagnostics, driver-assistance technology that enhance safety and convenience

1.2	Industrial IoT 

•	Manufacturing – Use of Iot devised to enable automation 
•	Supply chain and logistics – IoT to track goods, optimize inventory management, monitor shipment overall supply chain efficiency 
•	Smart infrastructure – Using IoT to manage and monitor infrastructure (water, energy grid, transport network) 

1.3	Enterprise IoT

•	Healthcare – Use of IoT devices to remote patient monitoring, health data management 
•	Retail – Inventory management, customer engagement, personalized shopping experience

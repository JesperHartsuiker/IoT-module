B) Breadboard and Electronic Prototyping (Pair)
The steps
1.	Install Arduino and the appropriate package 
2.	We plugged wemos d1 mini to the laptop 
3.	We made a connection to the breadboard through the gray cable(ground) and red (3 volts) connections. 
4.	Then we ran a welcome script to check if the board is well functioning 
5.	We used two cables- yellow(from + to +) and orange (from – to - ) to maintain the flow of electricity in a circuit. 
6.	Then we plugged the resistor to control the current flowing through the LEDs
7.	Finally we plugged the LED(yellow one) that is lid up. 
8.	We experimented by plugging two LED. The brightness is dimmed when they are connected at the same time. If its only one LED it is bright. 
 
 
C)Blink on the Wemos D1 Mini (Pair)
The steps


1.	We connect the wemos d1 mini to the laptop 
2.	We plugged the 3 wires (grey one from – to ground), yellow (from d6 to breadboard), red (from wemos d1 mini to plus on the breadboard).
3.	WE placed the resistor from the board to minus (-)
4.	We connected the LED cathode(negative) end to the minus of the breadboard with the resistor. 
5.	The LED started blinking in turn with the Wemos d1 board. 
6.	We ran different codes to make them blink async. 
 
 
D)Toggle Led with Button
 The steps

1.	We plugged wemos d1 mini to the laptop 
2.	We made a connection to the breadboard through the yellow cable(D5), the red one (from ground to breadboard), gray (from D2 to breadboard), the other red (from D1 to anode of  LED on the breadboard) . 
The code

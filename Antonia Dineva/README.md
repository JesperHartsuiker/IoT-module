This is my personal portfolio for the "Internet of Things" module, a part of the International MINOR in Global Acting in I.T. program at the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria.

## Hardware list 
For a comprehensive list of hardware required for the IoT module, please refer to the [IoT Hardware List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/190sODLejnHVpBGEm2-nC2-qgiPEmNxYNmoZCu8LaDyE/edit?usp=sharing). This list outlines the essential components and devices necessary for successful participation in the course.

## Classes with Ulno 
Here you can find the tasks that were assigned in class by Ulno to help us understand and dive into IoT concepts and their practical implications. The tasks from class with Ulno are structured as following: 

- [class01](/Antonia%20Dineva/Classes/class01)
- [class02](/Antonia%20Dineva/Classes/class02)
- [class03](/Antonia%20Dineva/Classes/class03)
- [class04](/Antonia%20Dineva/Classes/class04)
- [class05](/Antonia%20Dineva/Classes/class05)
- [class06](/Antonia%20Dineva/Classes/class06)


## Classes with Volker 

Here you can find the tasks that were assigned in class by Volker to help us dive deeper into IoT concepts and their practical implications. The tasks from class with Volker are structured as following:

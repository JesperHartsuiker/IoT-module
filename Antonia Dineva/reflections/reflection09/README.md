# Reflection class 09

### What did you learn, what do you aim to retain, and what advice can you offer?

Unremarkable Session: Today's class seemed unremarkable to me, given my prior familiarity with Networking and Communications concepts. Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge that revisiting these topics can serve as a valuable reinforcement of existing knowledge.

Value of Review: Revisiting familiar material, even if it appears redundant, can greatly aid in knowledge retention.

Timing of Lab Task Explanations: One suggestion for future sessions is to consider the timing of lab task explanations. It might be more effective to postpone these explanations until all students are present.

### Were There Any Enjoyable Struggles or Discoveries?

- Pleasant Class Dynamics: The interactive nature of the class made it enjoyable. Participating in discussions with peers and responding to various inquiries added a pleasant dimension to the learning experience.

### Were There Any Significant Hurdles Requiring Peer or Instructor Support?

Timing of Lab Task Explanations: To enhance the overall learning experience, it might be beneficial to delay the explanation of lab tasks until all students are present. This approach ensures that everyone can commence the tasks on the same page and minimizes potential confusion.

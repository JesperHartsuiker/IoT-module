# Reflection class 02

### What did you learn, what do you aim to retain, and what advice can you offer?

* Accomplishing specific tasks presented challenges that required both time and patience, underscoring the significance of persistence in the learning journey.
* Personally, tackling the programming aspect of the button functionality posed a significant challenge, highlighting the necessity of venturing beyond one's comfort zone when acquiring new skills.
* Seeking guidance from individuals skilled in coding proved to be a wise decision, expediting issue resolution. I recommend recognizing the need for assistance and reaching out to Jesper or Ulno and Volker without hesitation. Collaboration can significantly aid in overcoming obstacles and enhancing the learning experience

### Were There Any Enjoyable Struggles or Discoveries?

The sense of achievement and contentment upon successfully completing the small button project 

### Were There Any Significant Hurdles Requiring Peer or Instructor Support?

* The instructors' response appeared disheartening, especially when addressing the project segment of our MINOR. Encouraging the instructors to maintain a positive outlook, even in the face of challenges, could foster a more supportive and inspiring learning environment, benefiting all students involved.

# Reflection class 05

### What did you learn, what do you aim to retain, and what advice can you offer?

- The significance of persistence and teamwork: Despite encountering challenges and setbacks, the support from my entire Team Rocket and Ulno enabled the successful completion of tasks. 

- The gratification of overcoming obstacles: It is essential to recall the positive sensation of accomplishing tasks after grappling with difficulties. 

- I should prioritize paying attention to cable connections and comprehending voltage and amperage in electrical circuits to prevent simple connection errors. 
- Recognizing the value of user-friendly platforms such as IoTempower, which simplify the deployment and programming of microcontrollers, is crucial.


### Were There Any Enjoyable Struggles or Discoveries?

- Exploring the joy of learning and the contentment derived from witnessing the fruits of my labor has been a fundamental aspect of my educational journey. It is not solely about task completion and problem-solving but rather the process of discovery and personal growth. I have come to realize that the journey of exploration and problem-solving in my field is as, if not more, valuable than reaching the destination.

### Were There Any Significant Hurdles Requiring Peer or Instructor Support?

- One of the most crucial lessons learned is the importance of seeking assistance and guidance from both Ulno and my Team Rocket peers. Instructors play a role beyond delivering content, offering support, addressing queries, and providing valuable insights. I have found that reaching out to Ulno has been immensely beneficial when confronted with complex problems or in need of clarification.

- Equally vital has been the support from my Team Rocket peers. Collaborating with fellow students, exchanging ideas, and working together as a team have helped me understand the class material better.

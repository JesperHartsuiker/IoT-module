# Reflection class 03 

### What is your take-away, what do you want to remember, what would be your advice?

- Initiating a swift dive into the course material is crucial, allowing more time for hands-on experimentation and practical application. 

- The concise theoretical explanations offered during the course proved exceptionally beneficial, ensuring that we acquired the necessary foundational knowledge. I recommend adopting this approach in future courses to facilitate effective learning.

- When confronted with technical challenges, seeking assistance becomes essential. Collaborating with peers and seeking the guidance of knowledgeable instructors played a pivotal role in overcoming these hurdles.

### Were There Any Enjoyable Struggles or Discoveries?

Certainly, there were moments of enjoyable struggle and exploration, notably:

- Dealing with the hardware aspects presented notable challenges. Our difficulties encompassed network connectivity complications hindering access to the router configuration, and other complexities in setting up the hardware. 

- Regrettably, the technical challenges we faced hampered our ability to complete tasks within the allocated time. Despite this, the overall experience served as a lesson in persistence and problem-solving.

### Were There Any Significant Hurdles Requiring Peer or Instructor Support?

My interactions with peers and instructors played a critical role in overcoming show stoppers:

- We sought guidance from instructors when grappling with the hotspot configuration of our Raspberry Pi, which proved to be a technical challenge.

- Overall, the practical hardware component of the course presented a steep learning curve. It felt as though we were thrown into the deep end, navigating intricate tasks with limited prior knowledge of the involved components. While challenging, this experience emphasized the need for a more gradual and structured introduction to hardware aspects.

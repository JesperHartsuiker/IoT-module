# Reflection class 01

### What did you learn, what do you aim to retain, and what advice can you offer?

Here are the main points I gathered from my first day in the IoT course at the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria:

- The importance of IoT in today's computing landscape and its implications were emphasized.
- Rediscovering Arduino and re-familiarizing myself with its controllers was an enjoyable and enlightening experience.
- The well-structured class and the instructor's guidance made learning IoT concepts engaging and informative.
- Engaging with IoT devices and hands-on projects was enjoyable, despite the lengthy lecture.
- Overcoming challenges, particularly with asynchronous LED blinking, offered valuable learning opportunities.
- Exploring different LED examples and experimenting with IoT applications brought a sense of novelty to the learning process.

My suggestion is to welcome the challenges and intricacies that may arise when working with IoT devices and coding. Seek assistance from peers and instructors when necessary, as collaboration and the exchange of experiences can be extremely beneficial. 

### Were There Any Enjoyable Struggles or Discoveries?

Certainly, there were enjoyable aspects of "struggling" and exploration during the IoT course:

- Experimenting with Arduino and grappling with coding challenges and debugging provided an enjoyable and immersive learning experience.
- Exploring various LED examples and delving into IoT applications felt like a new beginning and added excitement to the learning process.
- Collaborating with Pol to tackle tasks and independently establishing a GitHub repository structure for personal portfolios and team projects was a fantastic experience, characterized by teamwork and exploration, which facilitated the effective organization of our content.

### Were There Any Significant Hurdles Requiring Peer or Instructor Support?

There was a notable "showstopper" moment when configuring a complex IoT project. During this juncture, I sought assistance from both instructors, Jesper and Roan. Their insights and solutions were invaluable in overcoming the obstacle and making progress with the project. This underscores the importance of seeking help when facing significant challenges, as the support of peers and instructors can be a vital part of the learning process.

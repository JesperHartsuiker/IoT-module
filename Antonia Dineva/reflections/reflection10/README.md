# Reflection class 10

### What did you learn, what do you aim to retain, and what advice can you offer?

Certificate Creation: Today, I managed to create a certificate following the instructions from the slides. However, the instructions lacked depth, relying heavily on screenshots that made it challenging to understand and reproduce the information accurately. 

### Were There Any Enjoyable Struggles or Discoveries?

- Uncharted Territory: The day's content provided a wealth of novelty and excitement, considering my lack of prior knowledge of Networking and Communications concepts. Exploring these topics can offer an opportunity for fresh learning experiences and the acquisition of new knowledge.

### Were There Any Significant Hurdles Requiring Peer or Instructor Support?

- Incomplete Tasks: Time constraints prevented the completion of all assigned tasks, indicating a potential need for additional guidance or clarification to meet the course requirements successfully.

- Limited Instructions: The instructions for creating the certificate lacked depth, relying heavily on screenshots, thereby hindering comprehension and replication. More comprehensive guidance in this aspect would prove beneficial.

# Day Five

After the fifth day I made a reflection on the fifth day. Based on four questions, I made the reflection.

### What is your take-away, what do you want to remember, what would be your advice?  

- It was a nice challenge to start using IoTempower today.
- When it started working I became more and more motivated to continue to fix the problems I had.
- How to deploy code to the esp32s is really easy and I want to remember them.
- I would recommend to split up the tasks in a smaller group so it will be easier to finish all the tasks.
        
### Was there any good/fun “struggling”/exploration?  

- We started the day struggling with getting the esp32's to start.
- It was fun when the assignments flew by, because all the tasks were working very quickly and it was a fun exploration to find out how it would work.


### Any show stoppers – anything where you should reach out to peers or instructors?

- I would recommend to other students so split up the tasks so the assingments go by quicker.
- The help from the teacher was really helpfull today. And that why the tasks went by quiker.

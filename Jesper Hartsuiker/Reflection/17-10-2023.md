# Reflection 17-10-2023

After the second day I made a reflection on the second day. Based on three questions, I made the reflection.

- What is your take-away, what do you want to remember, what would be your advice?
  - It was a difficult task to complete and it took some time.
  - For me it was difficult to program the button part because coding is not completely my thing. 
  - I asked for help from someone with coding knowledge and then the solution was found quicker.

- Was there any good/fun “struggling”/exploration?
  - It was good when I finally finished the small button project, because I had a lot of difficulty with the coding part.

- Any show stoppers – anything where you should reach out to peers or instructors?
  - The teachers were very sad because of our questions about the module and if we could do the project part of our minor. It would be better if the teachers would not be so sad after one set back.

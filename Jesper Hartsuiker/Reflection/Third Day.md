# Third Day

After the third day I made a reflection on the third day. Based on four questions, I made the reflection.

    What is your take-away, what do you want to remember, what would be your advice?
        The first day was a fast start up of the module. We started with the module right away after. It was a lot of information at the start of IoT, but that was not too bad. I’m pretty interested in this module subject and want to learn more about it. And also maybe improve a bit in coding. The first day was pretty easy for me and it went by real quick.

    Was there any good/fun “struggling”/exploration?
        I enjoyed the lab session of the day. I’m more of a guy who does hands-on stuff. The theory part is less interesting for me and I learn more when working on something myself. Making a start on trying to turn on lights with a microcontroller was very fun.

    Any show stoppers – anything where you should reach out to peers or instructors?
        I didn’t have any problems with the lesson of the day and I didn’t need to ask things about the IoT part. Only the Personal Portfolio was a bit unclear for me how we needed to make it and had to ask it to my peers.

# Reflection 31-10-2023

At the end of the class on 21-10-2023 I made a reflection on that day. Based on trhee questions, I made the reflection.

### What is your take-away, what do you want to remember, what would be your advice?  

- It was a big challenge to make the certificates and know how to find the right place and upload the made certificates. But making the certificates and using them is really good to know, for future projects involving a web page.
        
### Was there any good/fun “struggling”/exploration?  

- The struggle for today was to find out all the mqttbroker commands that there are. I was really thrown in blind in my opinion.
- The good fun was when the hole tasks were working out and the assignments were done for the day.

### Any show stoppers – anything where you should reach out to peers or instructors?

- The lesson was a bit chaotic and I was struggling with some things where we couldn't ask things to other students cause the teacher didn't want us to interupt by talking. Also the explaination of the teacher was really unclear and I didn't know what to do at first after the explaination.

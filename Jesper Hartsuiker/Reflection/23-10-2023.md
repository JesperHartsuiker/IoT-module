# Reflection 23-10-2023

After the sixth day I made a reflection on the sixth day. Based on trhee questions, I made the reflection.

### What is your take-away, what do you want to remember, what would be your advice?  

- The lock challenge was a fun challenge to overcome.
- Making it with two was a breeze to make it and by splitting the tasks it went by even faster.
        
### Was there any good/fun “struggling”/exploration?  

- The fun part was when we got to use the buzzer to annoy people with the sounds.
- Making the lock project was a good and big challenge but was done in a few hours with the IoTempower gui.

### Any show stoppers – anything where you should reach out to peers or instructors?

- The only thing that stopped us, is about the teachers. Sometimes it gets very chaotic with the excitement of the teachers and the time. But today they blamed us on loosing some stuff, while they took it home themself or gave everything we needed to one group.

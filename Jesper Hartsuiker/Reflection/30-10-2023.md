# Reflection 30-10-2023

After the last monday I made a reflection on that day. Based on trhee questions, I made the reflection.

### What is your take-away, what do you want to remember, what would be your advice?  

- For me this lesson was very straight forward, I have done Cyber Security before and this was very straight forward for me and I had this topic a few times before with encryption.
        
### Was there any good/fun “struggling”/exploration?  

- Everything we did today I already knew from my previous topics from school that why nothing was new for me and that why it was a bit boring for me personally, but I worked a bit further during the class.

### Any show stoppers – anything where you should reach out to peers or instructors?

- There were no show stoppers for me, the only thing I would say is wait with explaining the lab tasks what we need to do when everyone is here.

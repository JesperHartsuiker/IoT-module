# Fourth Day

## Starting Node-Red
I downloaded the Node-Red installation for windows, so I could host the Node-Red page on my own laptop.  

I downloaded the Node-Red installer from this link: https://nodejs.org/en  

Next I opened my cmd in Windows and used this command to finish the Node-Red installation: npm install -g --unsafe-perm node-red  

After the installation is finished to start Node-Red I used the command: node-red. This will now start up Node-Red, and the cmd should not be closed, otherwise the Node-Red session will end.

To open Node-Red in the webbrowser, use localhost:1880. This will open the Node-Red gui and here you can make the flows. 
The Node-Red gui is an interactive programmer and I used it to rebuild the same thing I made on day three with Python, but then with no code. In the picture below you can see this code:

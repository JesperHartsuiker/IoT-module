# Day Two


    Internet:
        Represents the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. In the context of IoT, it serves as the overarching network connecting different IoT components.

    Server and Cloud:
        Servers act as the backbone of the IoT infrastructure, managing data and serving requests from various IoT devices.
        Cloud services provide scalable and virtualized resources and platforms for IoT applications, enabling data storage, processing, and analysis on a large scale.

    Edge and Fog:
        Edge computing involves processing data near the edge of the network, closer to the source of data. It helps reduce latency and bandwidth usage.
        Fog computing extends the concept of edge computing by facilitating the operation of compute, storage, and networking services between end devices and cloud computing data centers.

    Swarm and Nodes:
        Swarm computing refers to a group of interconnected devices or nodes that work together in a decentralized and self-organizing manner to perform a task.
        Nodes represent individual devices or sensors in the IoT network that collect and transmit data.

    Gateway:
        Gateways act as intermediaries between IoT devices and the central network. They enable communication, data flow, and protocol translation between different devices.

    Things:
        Things encompass all the physical devices, objects, or machines that are embedded with sensors, software, or other technologies to exchange data with other connected devices or systems.

**Takeaways and Advice:**
- The task on the second day was challenging and time-consuming.
- I faced difficulties, especially with the coding part related to the button.
- Seeking help from someone with coding knowledge proved to be a quicker solution. My advice would be not to hesitate to ask for help when faced with coding challenges.

**Good/Fun "Struggling" and Exploration:**
- It was satisfying when I finally completed the small button project, even though I struggled with the coding aspect.

**Show Stoppers and Seeking Help:**
- The instructors' reactions to our questions about the module and the project part of our minor were not very encouraging. It would be better if the instructors were more supportive after setbacks.

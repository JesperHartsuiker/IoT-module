# Reflection 20-10-2023

### What is your take-away, what do you want to remember, what would be your advice?

- **Takeaway:** Starting to use IoTempower presented a nice challenge today. As I made progress and overcame initial difficulties, my motivation to tackle the problems increased. I want to remember how to deploy code to the ESP32s because it was straightforward and efficient. My advice is to split tasks into smaller groups to streamline task completion.

### Was there any good/fun “struggling”/exploration?

- **Struggles:** The day began with challenges in getting the ESP32s to start, which was a learning experience in itself.

- **Exploration:** It was enjoyable when the assignments proceeded smoothly, as all the tasks worked quickly. It was a fun exploration to see how everything fell into place.

### Any show stoppers – anything where you should reach out to peers or instructors?

- I recommend to other students to split up tasks into smaller groups to expedite task completion.
- The help from the teacher was very helpful today, contributing to the swift progression of tasks.

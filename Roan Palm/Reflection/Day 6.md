# Reflection: 23-10-2023

In retrospect, reflecting on the sixth day brought insights and experiences, answering three key questions.

## Key Takeaways and Advice

- The lock challenge was an enjoyable experience, and I'd like to remember how rewarding it was to overcome it.
- Collaborating as a team of two made the task significantly easier; dividing tasks expedited the process.

## Memorable Moments in Struggling and Exploration

- Exploring the capabilities, particularly the use of the buzzer, brought a fun element to the project, albeit sometimes annoying others with its sounds.
- Tackling the lock project was a substantial challenge, yet the IoTempower GUI enabled us to complete it swiftly within a few hours.

## Challenges and Areas for Improvement

- Show stoppers were minimal, except for occasional chaotic moments involving instructors. Sometimes, their enthusiasm caused confusion and disrupted our flow.
- There were instances where blame was unjustly placed on our group for losing materials, whereas it seemed they were either taken home by instructors or distributed to another group.

Overall, the experience was enriching, but refining coordination with instructors and ensuring better communication might enhance the overall process and avoid misunderstandings.

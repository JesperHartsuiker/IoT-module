# Reflection: 30-10-2023

Upon reflecting on the latest Monday session, I found myself contemplating three key aspects of the day's activities.

## Key Insights and Advice

- The lesson felt like a revisit for me, given my prior exposure to Cyber Security and encryption topics. It was straightforward and familiar.
- I would recommend holding off on explaining lab tasks until everyone is present, ensuring everyone benefits from the instructions simultaneously.

## Notable Moments in Learning

- As someone with previous knowledge in the field, the day's activities lacked novelty and felt repetitive. However, I utilized the class time to reinforce my understanding of the covered concepts.

## Challenges and Opportunities for Improvement

- Personally, I didn't encounter any significant obstacles during the session.
- I suggest postponing the explanation of lab tasks until all participants are present to optimize the learning experience for everyone.

The session felt routine due to my existing familiarity with the subject matter. However, optimizing the timing of instructions could enhance the learning experience for the entire group.

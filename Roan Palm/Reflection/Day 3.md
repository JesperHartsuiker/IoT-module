### What is your take-away, what do you want to remember, what would be your advice?

- **Takeaway:** I've learned the importance of a quick start, concise theory, and seeking help when facing technical difficulties. Communicating via MQTT was surprisingly easy, and simulating the thermostat and AC provided practical insights.

- **Advice:** Don't hesitate to seek help when you encounter technical challenges.

### Was there any good/fun “struggling”/exploration?

- **Exploration:** It was enjoyable to create simulations for the thermostat and AC, providing a hands-on experience.

- **Struggles:** However, working with the hardware proved to be challenging, and we needed assistance from multiple peers.

### Any show stoppers – anything where you should reach out to peers or instructors?

- I received valuable assistance from my peers, particularly with the hardware part of the lab.
- The instructors were helpful in resolving issues related to the Raspberry Pi's hotspot functionality.
- However, the practical hardware aspect was challenging, and it felt like we were thrown into the deep end with little prior knowledge of the components, making it difficult to find solutions.

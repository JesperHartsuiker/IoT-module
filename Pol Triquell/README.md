# Pol Triquell Personal Portfolio

## Introduction

Welcome to my Personal Portfolio for the "Internet of Things" module, a part of the [International MINOR in Global Acting in I.T.](https://www-eps-udl-cat.translate.goog/ca/internacional/minor-internacional-global-acting-in-ict-00001/?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en-EN&_x_tr_hl=auto) program at the [University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria](https://www.fh-ooe.at/en/).

This portfolio is a compilation of the reports, research, and reflections related to the practical activities and tasks completed during the IoT module. It aims to provide an overview of my learning journey and showcase the knowledge and skills gained throughout the course.

## Hardware List

For a comprehensive list of hardware required for the IoT module, please refer to the [IoT Hardware List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/190sODLejnHVpBGEm2-nC2-qgiPEmNxYNmoZCu8LaDyE/edit?usp=sharing). This list outlines the essential components and devices necessary for successful participation in the course.

## Ulno Research

In the "Ulno Research" section, you will find a comprehensive collection of research tasks assigned by Ulno. These tasks are designed to deepen our understanding of IoT concepts and their practical applications. The Ulno research tasks are organized as follows:

- [Research 01](/Pol%20Triquell/researches/research01)
- [Research 02](/Pol%20Triquell/researches/research02)
- [Research 03](/Pol%20Triquell/researches/research03)
- [Research 04](/Pol%20Triquell/researches/research04)
- [Research 05](/Pol%20Triquell/researches/research05)
- [Research 06](/Pol%20Triquell/researches/research06)

These tasks cover various aspects of IoT technology and its implications as assigned by Ulno.

## Volker Research

In the "Volker Research" section, you will find another set of research tasks assigned by Volker. These tasks complement our understanding of IoT concepts and their practical applications. The Volker research tasks are organized as follows:

- [Research 09](/Pol%20Triquell/researches/research09)
- [Research 10](/Pol%20Triquell/researches/research10)

These tasks provide additional insights into IoT technology and its implications as assigned by Volker.

## Ulno Reflections

The "Ulno Reflections" section is where my personal insights and thoughts about the IoT module as assigned by Ulno are documented. This section contains reflections as follows:

- [Reflection 01](/Pol%20Triquell/reflections/reflection01)
- [Reflection 02](/Pol%20Triquell/reflections/reflection02)
- [Reflection 03](/Pol%20Triquell/reflections/reflection03)
- [Reflection 04](/Pol%20Triquell/reflections/reflection04)
- [Reflection 05](/Pol%20Triquell/reflections/reflection05)
- [Reflection 06](/Pol%20Triquell/reflections/reflection06)

These Ulno reflections offer insights into my evolving perspectives on IoT and its role in the world of technology as assigned by Ulno.

## Volker Reflections

The "Volker Reflections" section is where my personal insights and thoughts about the IoT module as assigned by Volker are documented. This section contains reflections as follows:

- [Reflection 09](/Pol%20Triquell/reflections/reflection09)
- [Reflection 10](/Pol%20Triquell/reflections/reflection10)

These Volker reflections provide additional insights into my evolving perspectives on IoT and its role in the world of technology as assigned by Volker.

## Team Workspace

Additionally, there is a dedicated section called [Team Workspace](../Team%20Workspace/README.md) that provides access to collaborative resources and materials related to our group projects. This section offers a glimpse into the collective efforts and innovative undertakings of our team during the IoT module.

Feel free to navigate through this portfolio to gain insights into the IoT module, from research and practical activities to personal reflections and team collaborations. I hope you find this portfolio valuable in your IoT learning journey.

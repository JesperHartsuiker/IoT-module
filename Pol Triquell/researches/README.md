# Researches

## Researches made through the whole IoT module

Within this category, we document a wide array of hands-on exercises and tasks that we've tackled in our IoT course. These activities help us reinforce our understanding of IoT concepts and put theory into practice. The research tasks are organized as follows:

* [Research 01](../researches/research01/)
* [Research 02](../researches/research02/)
* [Research 03](../researches/research03/)
* [Research 04](../researches/research04/)
* [Research 05](../researches/research05/)
* [Research 06](../researches/research06/)

* [Research 09](../researches/research09/)
* [Research 10](../researches/research10/)

These tasks cover various aspects of IoT technology and its implications.

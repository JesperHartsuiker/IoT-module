# Reflections

## Tenth day at lectures

## Lecture and Lab reflection

### What is your take-away, what do you want to remember, what would be your advice?

From today's session, I drew several key takeaways and pieces of advice:

  * Uninspiring Day: Much like yesterday, today has continued to be rather uneventful. I didn't find much meaning in the section on cybersecurity that we covered today. The slides seemed convoluted, and the explanations were overly specific. Additionally, I didn't have enough time to complete all the tasks assigned by the professor.

  * Certificate Creation: Today, I managed to create a certificate on my own by following the instructions from the slides. However, I believe this part needed more thorough explanations as the instructions consisted of screenshots that made it challenging to copy or understand the information clearly and concisely. The other tasks appeared difficult because there were no step-by-step instructions provided. Nevertheless, I succeeded in installing this certificate in the Mozilla Firefox browser.

  * Feedback and Repository: I received feedback from Professor Ulno on my Github repository work, enabling me to see areas for improvement and alignment with the professor's desired structure for the portfolio. In recent days, I had been quite focused and concerned about the repository's structure, and receiving the professor's feedback today has made me feel more confident about the work that needs to be submitted with the portfolio.

  * Previous Experience: I had previously created a certificate, and that is why this part also seemed relatively easy to me. However, I had created it from the Linux command line rather than using a graphical interface like XCA.


### Was there any good/fun “struggling”/exploration?

Although the session did not present any challenging or particularly enjoyable moments for me, there were elements worth noting:

  * Familiar Territory: The content covered today did not offer much in terms of excitement or exploration for me since I had prior knowledge of Networking and Communications concepts. It is essential to acknowledge that revisiting these topics can serve as a valuable reinforcement of existing knowledge.

### Any show stoppers – anything where you should reach out to peers or instructors?

Today, as in the previous session, there were some challenges that could be considered show stoppers:

  * Lackluster Engagement: The material covered today, particularly in the realm of cybersecurity, left me feeling disconnected. The presentation slides were convoluted, and the explanations provided were excessively specific. This lack of clarity and engagement made it difficult to absorb the content effectively.

  * Incomplete Tasks: Regrettably, I could not complete all the tasks assigned by the professor due to time constraints. This is an area where I may require additional guidance or clarification to ensure I can successfully fulfill the course requirements.

  * Limited Instructions: While I was able to create a certificate independently by following the instructions from the slides, I found the instructions to be lacking in depth. The reliance on screenshots made it challenging to copy and comprehend the information thoroughly. Additional guidance in this regard would be greatly beneficial.

  * Missing Step-by-Step Guidance: The absence of step-by-step instructions for certain tasks made them considerably challenging. Having a more detailed breakdown of the processes would enhance the learning experience and help in achieving the course objectives more effectively.

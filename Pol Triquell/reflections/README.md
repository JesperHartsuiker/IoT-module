# Reflections

## Reflections made through the whole IoT module

Within this category, we document a widze array of hands-on exercises and tasks that we've tackled in our IoT course. These activities help us reinforce our understanding of IoT concepts and put theory into practice. The research tasks are organized as follows:

* [Reflection 01](../reflections/reflection01/)
* [Reflection 02](../reflections/reflection02/)
* [Reflection 03](../reflections/reflection03/)
* [Reflection 04](../reflections/reflection04/)
* [Reflection 05](../reflections/reflection05/)
* [Reflection 06](../reflections/reflection06/)

* [Reflection 09](../reflections/reflection09/)
* [Reflection 10](../reflections/reflection10/)

These tasks cover various aspects of IoT technology and its implications.

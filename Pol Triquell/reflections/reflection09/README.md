# Reflections

## Ninth day at lectures

## Lecture and Lab reflection

### What is your take-away, what do you want to remember, what would be your advice?

From today's session, I drew several key takeaways and pieces of advice:

  * Uneventful Session: Today's class was relatively uneventful for me due to my prior familiarity with the Networking and Communications concepts. However, it's important to recognize that revisiting these topics can serve as a valuable reinforcement of existing knowledge.

  * Benefit of Revision: Revisiting familiar material, even if it seems redundant, can be highly beneficial for knowledge retention. It's a reminder that consistent review is crucial for maintaining expertise in a subject.

  * Lab Task Explanation Timing: One piece of advice for future sessions is to consider the timing of lab task explanations. It may be more efficient to delay these explanations until everyone is present, ensuring that all students can benefit from a smoother learning experience.

### Was there any good/fun “struggling”/exploration?

Although the session didn't present any challenging or particularly fun moments for me, there were elements worth noting:

  * Enjoyable Class Dynamics: The class was enjoyable due to its interactive nature. Engaging in discussions with peers and responding to various questions added an enjoyable dimension to the learning experience.

### Any show stoppers – anything where you should reach out to peers or instructors?

Fortunately, there were no significant obstacles that necessitated reaching out to peers or instructors. However, a minor suggestion for improvement is:

  * Timing of Lab Task Explanation: To enhance the overall learning experience, it might be beneficial to delay the explanation of lab tasks until all students are present, ensuring that everyone can start on the same page and minimizing potential confusion.

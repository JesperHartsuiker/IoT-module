# Reflections

## First day at lectures

## Lecture and Lab reflection

Today was the first day of the IoT module at the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria, and we had to get used to the cold weather and the class setup. In summary, my key takeaways from the day were the importance of IoT in the current computer world and its consequences. We also began experimenting with Arduino, and even though I already had some prior experience, it was a lot of fun to dive back into its world and remember how all the controllers worked.

The class structure and the instructor's guidance were nice and easy. The organized approach to learning IoT concepts and practical applications made the learning experience engaging and informative. Even though the lecture was quite long in terms of time, it was a good thing because it allowed us to delve deeply into the subject matter. Working with IoT devices and creating hands-on projects was especially enjoyable but the lecture lasted for too long.

I faced some difficulties when working with asynchronous LED blinking. The complexities of coding and debugging presented challenges, but overcoming these struggles provided valuable learning experiences.

One enjoyable aspect of the course was exploring and experimenting with various LED examples. It felt like starting over again, and that was amazing. Overcoming challenges and experimenting with novel IoT applications added a fun element to the learning experience.

I encountered a showstopper when configuring a complex IoT project. I reached out to both instructors and peers for assistance, and their insights and solutions helped me move forward.

My interactions with peers and instructors were highly collaborative and enriching. Peers provided valuable feedback, shared their experiences, and assisted in overcoming technical hurdles. In particular, the teamwork with my partner was really amazing. We joined forces, working together seamlessly to tackle the tasks at hand. We even created a GitHub repository where we personalized the folder structure for our personal portfolios and the team structure for collaborative work and instructors offered guidance and promptly answered questions, making the learning journey more effective and enjoyable.

With my partner, we succeeded in all the tasks that we needed to do with Arduino, and we had a blast doing them. It was a fantastic day filled with learning, teamwork, and a lot of fun.

I was able to assist a fellow student who faced similar coding challenges, such as blinking LEDs and setting up the Wemos D1 Mini. I also provided feedback on project ideas and coding techniques, contributing to a supportive learning environment for all participants.

# Reflections

## First day at lectures

## Lecture and Lab reflection

### What is your take-away, what do you want to remember, what would be your advice?

My key takeaways from the first day of the IoT module at the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria are as follows:

* The significance of IoT in today's computer world and its implications were highlighted.
* Revisiting Arduino and reacquainting myself with its controllers was enjoyable and insightful.
* The structured class and guidance from the instructor made learning IoT concepts engaging and informative.
* Working with IoT devices and hands-on projects was fun, despite the lengthy lecture.
* Overcoming challenges, especially with asynchronous LED blinking, provided valuable learning experiences.
* Exploring various LED examples and experimenting with IoT applications added a sense of novelty to the learning process.
* Collaborative interactions with peers and instructors enriched the learning experience, with valuable assistance and feedback.

My advice is to embrace the challenges and complexities that may arise when working with IoT devices and coding. Seek help from peers and instructors when needed, as collaboration and sharing of experiences can be immensely beneficial. Additionally, maintaining a positive and inquisitive mindset will make the learning journey more enjoyable and rewarding.

### Was there any good/fun “struggling”/exploration?

Yes, there were enjoyable aspects of "struggling" and exploration during the IoT module:

* Experimenting with Arduino and facing challenges in coding and debugging provided a fun and engaging learning experience.
* Exploring various LED examples and experimenting with IoT applications felt like a fresh start and added excitement to the learning process.
* Collaborating with Antonia to tackle tasks and create by myself a GitHub repository structure for personal portfolios and team projects was an amazing experience, filled with teamwork and exploration, helped to have a nice organization of our contents.

### Any show stoppers – anything where you should reach out to peers or instructors?

There was one significant "showstopper" moment when configuring a complex IoT project. In this situation, I reached out to both instructors and Jesper and Roan for assistance. Their insights and solutions were invaluable in overcoming the obstacle and progressing with the project. This highlights the importance of seeking help when encountering major challenges, as the support of peers and instructors can be a crucial part of the learning process.

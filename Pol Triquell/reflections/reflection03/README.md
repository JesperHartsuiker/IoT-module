# Reflections

## Third day at lectures

## Lecture and Lab reflection

### What is your take-away, what do you want to remember, what would be your advice?

From this experience, several takeaways stand out:

  * Importance of a Quick Start: Getting a quick start on the course material is vital, as it allows more time for experimentation and practical work. I learned that diving into the subject matter promptly can be immensely beneficial.

  * Value of Concise Theory: The concise theory provided during the course was particularly helpful. It ensured that we had the necessary background knowledge without overwhelming us with excessive information. I would recommend embracing this approach in future courses to facilitate effective learning.

  * Benefits of Seeking Help: When encountering technical difficulties, seeking assistance is key. Communicating via MQTT was surprisingly straightforward, but when it came to hardware, I faced multiple challenges. Collaborating with peers and seeking their expertise, as well as utilizing the knowledge of instructors, was crucial in overcoming these hurdles. My advice is not to hesitate to ask for help, as it can save significant time and effort.

### Was there any good/fun “struggling”/exploration?

Certainly, there were moments of enjoyable struggle and exploration, notably:

  * However, the hardware aspect presented significant challenges. Our struggles included technical issues with my computer, network connectivity problems that hindered access to the router configuration, and other difficulties in configuring the hardware. We eventually had to resort to using Toni's computer, which added complexity to the process due to its slow performance. This hands-on experience, while challenging, also offered valuable learning opportunities.

  * Unfortunately, due to the aforementioned technical challenges, we encountered difficulties in completing the tasks within the allocated time. The overall experience was a lesson in perseverance and problem-solving.

### Any show stoppers – anything where you should reach out to peers or instructors?

My interactions with peers and instructors played a critical role in overcoming show stoppers:

  * My computer's issues, network connection problems, and the inability to configure the router were significant roadblocks. In this regard, my peers provided crucial assistance. They were instrumental in helping us navigate the complexities of the hardware setup.

  * We also sought help from instructors when dealing with the hotspot configuration of our Raspberry Pi, which proved to be a technical challenge.

  * One overarching observation is that the practical hardware aspect of the course presented a steep learning curve. It felt as though we were thrown into the deep end, navigating complex tasks with limited prior knowledge of the components involved. While it was a challenging experience, it underscored the need for a more gradual and structured introduction to hardware aspects in future courses, ensuring that students are well-prepared to tackle these challenges effectively.

In conclusion, today offered valuable lessons in effective learning, the importance of seeking help when needed, and the need for a balanced approach to theory and practical work. The challenges encountered served as opportunities for growth and skill development, but also highlighted areas for improvement in course design and support structures.

# Reflections

## Second day at lectures

## Lecture and Lab reflection

### What is your take-away, what do you want to remember, what would be your advice?

  * Completing certain tasks proved challenging and time-consuming. This experience emphasized the importance of patience and persistence in the learning process.
  * Personally, I found programming the button functionality to be a formidable task, as coding is not my strongest suit. It reinforced the idea that learning new skills often involves stepping out of one's comfort zone.
  * Seeking assistance from someone with coding expertise was a wise decision, as it significantly expedited problem resolution. My advice is to recognize when you require help and not hesitate to reach out to peers or instructors. Collaboration can be a valuable tool in overcoming hurdles and learning more effectively.

### Was there any good/fun “struggling”/exploration?

Indeed, there were moments of enjoyable struggle and exploration:

  * The sense of accomplishment and satisfaction upon successfully finishing the small button project was significant. This particular task had been challenging due to my difficulties with the coding aspect, but overcoming it brought a sense of achievement.


### Any show stoppers – anything where you should reach out to peers or instructors?

One noteworthy aspect was the response of the instructors to our inquiries about the module and the feasibility of completing the project portion of our minor:

  * The teachers appeared disheartened in response to our questions, particularly concerning the project component of our minor. It would be beneficial if the instructors could maintain a more positive outlook, even in the face of setbacks, to create a more encouraging and supportive learning environment. This could foster a more constructive and motivating atmosphere for all students involved.

In conclusion, the second day of the IoT module provided valuable insights into the learning process, emphasizing the importance of patience, collaboration, and seeking help when needed. It also highlighted the significance of maintaining a positive and encouraging atmosphere within the learning environment to facilitate the best outcomes for all students.

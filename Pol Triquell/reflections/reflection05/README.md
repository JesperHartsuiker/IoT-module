# Reflections

## Fifth day at lectures

## Lecture and Lab reflection

### What is your take-away, what do you want to remember, what would be your advice?

   * The importance of perseverance and teamwork: Even when we faced challenges and setbacks, with the support of my whole Team Rocket and Ulno, we were able to complete the tasks successfully. This highlights the significance of collaboration and not giving up in the face of difficulties.

   * The satisfaction of overcoming obstacles: It is crucial for me to remember the positive feeling of accomplishing tasks after facing difficulties. This can serve as motivation for my future endeavors.

   * I need to pay attention to cable connections and understanding voltage and amperage in electrical circuits to prevent simple connection errors. I should also consider dividing the group into subgroups for more efficient work and collaboration.

   * I should recognize the value of user-friendly platforms like IoTempower, which make it easier to deploy and program microcontrollers.

### Was there any good/fun “struggling”/exploration?

   * Exploring the joy of learning and the satisfaction of seeing my efforts pay off has been a crucial aspect of my educational journey. It is not just about completing tasks and solving problems; it is about the process of discovery and growth. I have come to realize that the journey of exploration and problem-solving in my field is just as, if not more, valuable than the destination.

   * Learning is not a linear path; it is a series of twists and turns, challenges, and breakthroughs. Embracing this exploration has given me a greater appreciation for the subject matter and the satisfaction that comes with overcoming obstacles.


### Any show stoppers – anything where you should reach out to peers or instructors?

   * One of the most significant lessons I have learned is the importance of seeking help and guidance from Ulno and my Team Rockets peers. Instructors are not just there to deliver content but to provide support, answer questions, and offer valuable insights. I have found that when I have faced complex problems or needed clarification, reaching out to Ulno has been incredibly beneficial.

   * Equally important has been the support from my Team Rocket members. Collaborating with fellow students, sharing ideas, and working together as a team have not only made the learning experience more enjoyable but have also enriched my understanding of the subject matter
